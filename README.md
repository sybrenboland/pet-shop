## Development

You can build, test, and install the project locally with
the [Rug CLI][cli].

[cli]: https://github.com/atomist/rug-cli

```
$ ( cd .atomist && npm test )
$ rug install
```

To clean up cached files run:

```
$ ( cd .atomist && npm run clean )
```

To return this project to its distributed state run:

```
$ ( cd .atomist && npm run distclean )
```

You will need to install its dependencies again after this:

```
$ ( cd .atomist && npm install )
```

To create a new release of the project, simply push a tag of the form
`M.N.P` where `M`, `N`, and `P` are integers that form the next
appropriate [semantic version][semver] for release.  For example:

[semver]: http://semver.org

```
$ git tag -a 1.2.3
```

The Travis CI build (see badge at the top of this page) will
automatically create a GitHub release using the tag name for the
release and the comment provided on the annotated tag as the contents
of the release notes.  It will also automatically upload the needed
artifacts.
